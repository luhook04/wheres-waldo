# Where's Waldo 

[Live Preview](https://luhook04.github.io/wheres-waldo/)

This is a Where's Waldo app that times how long the user takes to find 4 characters on a screen. This app was really fun and challenging to make. The hardest part of the project was getting the app to work on all screen sizes. This was challenging to do, but I was able to do it by getting a ratio of the offset value of the click and dividing by the width of the div. Another challenge was allowing the user to click near a character in order to find them. This was solved by seeing if the sum of the distance of the x and y coordinates added up to a number less than my range. 

I also used Firebase with this app because I wanted to be able to display the leaderboards for who found Waldo the fastest. This makes it so people from all around can view each other's times.
